Approach: we will use a set of representative pedigrees going back ~4 generations (so as to represent all 3rd/4th cousins), with data on each personâ€™s date of birth, gender, and [ideally] place of residence.  With this non-genetic data, we can estimate how many 3rd/4th cousins would be investigated. For each individual, we can calculate that number, thus producing an empirical distribution.
