Question: based on real pedigree data, when a 3rd-ish cousin has been correctly identified, how many family members of similar age/gender/(and maybe location) will be identified?  What’s the distribution?  
What about in different population/national groups with different norms about family structure?  
How does this extend for more distant relationships (like if police decided they could go further to 5th cousins etc)?

Approach: we will use a set of representative pedigrees going back ~4 generations (so as to represent all 3rd/4th cousins), with data on each person’s date of birth, gender, and [ideally] place of residence.  With this non-genetic data, we can estimate how many 3rd/4th cousins would be investigated. For each individual, we can calculate that number, thus producing an empirical distribution.
